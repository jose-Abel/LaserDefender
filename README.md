# Laser Defender

Project build on the Unity Game Engine and using C# programming language where I built an scalable game called "Laser Defender" following the guide in the Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" created by Ben Tristem, GameDev.tv Team and Rick Davidson.

The Game has 3 scenes: Start Menu, Game and Game Over but it can be added more scenes as levels with different Enemies prefabs and different Enemies Paths.
